# alpha-tabs

## About

Have you ever found yourself with multiple windows, each window with so many tabs open, you don't even see the icon? This is a chrome extension to sort your tabs alphabetically. Efficient and fun way to help you keep organized :) This project was inspired by Nagisa Day, a friend who also helped mentor me with this project :)
